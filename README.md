# Jaeyeon Won – Interactive Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with **Next.js**, bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

The site features a **chat-based interface** that allows visitors to explore my experience, projects, and skills interactively.  
It is designed to showcase not only my work, but also my ability to design, structure, and ship real software systems.

## 🎯 Why This Portfolio?

Rather than a static webpage, this portfolio uses a chat-based interface to guide visitors through my work.
This design reflects how I approach software engineering: focusing on clarity, user interaction, and structured problem-solving.
